    <h2>Easy chili to make on a busy day.</h2>
    <p>My father and I created this easy 5-ingredient chili recipe and everyone we have made it for loved it. It is fast, simple, and delicious.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Kidney beans</li>
        <li>Chili beans</li>
        <li>Chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>

        <li>Stir in kidney beans, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Bring to a boil and stir in chili powder. Reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
